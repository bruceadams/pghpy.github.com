Just a few notes for contributors to the pghpython.org website.

I've made it use AngularJS to bind a simple JSON datastructure
to the table output. We can possibly extend this to do some snazzy
dynamic things like highlighting the next upcoming events.

To simply add an event, add any new presenters or locations
to the presenters and locations objects in events.json, then add the
event with references to the keys for the presenter and location.

Hopefully this will make things easier. If everyone hates it, we can
do something else.
